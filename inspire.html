            <p> We CAN do it. In trying times like these, the burden of the world's problems may weigh us down. It's more important now than ever to look after ourselves

                                The Salt March in the 1930s was a protest of British rule in India led by Mahatma Gandhi. The demonstration was against the repressive British salt tax. 
                                The protestors walked over 240 miles to the Arabian Sea coast to make salt, in defiance of the Salt Act of 1882. While over a 100,000 people were arrested, including
                                Gandhi himself, the Salt March is considered a turning point in Indian independence. In 1931, an agreement was met to end the protests in exchange for the end of the salt tax.
                                Indians from all over were inspired by the chance of justice, and their voices eventually led to Indian's independence from Britain in 1947. The Salt March remains to be a clear 
                                example that civil disobedience is an effective technique in fighting social and political injustices.

                                The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 stemmed from the outrage over the racial injustice in America. Leaders and civil rights groups, including the NAACP,
                                from all over joined in the fight to end racial discrimination against African Americans from jobs and gain their freedom. It was during this march that Dr. Martin Luther
                                King Jr. gave his famous speech, 'I Have a Dream', where he channeled his frustrations into his hopes about the future. Empowering the world with his dreams, "I have a dream 
                                that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today."
                                After continued protests for civil rights and political action, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the National Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
                                Segregation and the disenfranchisment of minorities was officially illegal.

                                    The National Equality March in 2009 was a political protest fighting for equal rights for the LGBT community. Thousands of activists were outraged by the lack of same-sex marriage 
                                    legalization and continued discrimination against LGBT people, such as not allowing gays to serve in the military. With the continued activism and protest over the years, in 2011 
                                    'Don't Ask Don't Tell', requiring gay Americans to remain closeted to serve in military, was repealed by President Obama.

                        Letting the world's problems affect our happiness is unproductive. Educate yourself, register to vote, and discuss with others. 
                        That's all you can do. You will be part of the change.

                    <li> 
                        It is OK to disconnect from social media and news outlets for some time. You will burnout if you try to stay on top of everything 
                        that is going on. Treat it as a good sign - there's so much action and momentum for change. Remembering to prioritize your hobbies,
                        baking that banana bread, and enjoying a walk outside should be at the top of your to-do list. 

                    </li>

                    <li> 
                        Meditate, breathe. Take at least 5 minutes of your day to let your mind relax completely. Start your mornings off with Spotify's Daily Wellness
                        or free youtube morning mediations. We can't change the world without an open, clear mind.

                       Don't worry. As Dalai Lama said, "Sometimes we feel we canâ€™t do much by ourselves, but humanity is made up of individuals; we can make a difference. As individuals we can influence our own families. Our families can shape our communities and our communities form our nations. Together we can make a better world."
