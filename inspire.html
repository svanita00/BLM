                                The Salt March in the 1930s was a protest of British rule in India led by Mahatma Gandhi. The demonstration was against the repressive British salt tax. 
                                The protestors walked over 240 miles to the Arabian Sea coast to make salt, in defiance of the Salt Act of 1882. While over a 100,000 people were arrested, including
                                Gandhi himself, the Salt March is considered a turning point in Indian independence. In 1931, an agreement was met to end the protests in exchange for the end of the salt tax.
                                Indians from all over were inspired by the chance of justice, and their voices eventually led to Indian's independence from Britain in 1947. The Salt March remains to be a clear 
                                example that civil disobedience is an effective technique in fighting social and political injustices.
